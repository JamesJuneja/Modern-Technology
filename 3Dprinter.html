<h2> 3D Printing</h2>

<h3> What is it?</h3>

<p>3D printing, also known as additive manufacturing, is the process of making a physical object from a 
    three-dimensional digital model</p>

    <h3> How does it work?</h3>

<p> 3D printing, also known as additive manufacturing, is a process that creates a physical object 
    from a digital design. It works by building up an object layer by layer. The “blueprint” or digital 
    design for the object is usually created in a Computer Aided Design (CAD) file. The 3D printer 
    reads this file, and then deposits layers of material (such as plastic, metal, or ceramic) one 
    on top of the other to create the object. This process allows for complex and intricate designs to be
     created relatively easily. It’s used in a variety of industries, including manufacturing, medicine,
      architecture, and even food production.
